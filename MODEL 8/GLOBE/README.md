REMARK 1):  In this folder are 'converted' Model 8 screens for 'NEW' Editor files (all filenames starting with NX...); both for Basic and Enhanced screens;
the Editor is available (for free) at www.nextion.tech.

REMARK 2):  All my screens are using the ON7LDS NextionDriver (www.github.com/on7lds); set screen layout to ON7LDS L3.

* The ON7LDS is candidate to be integrated soon in Pi-Star's 'core' setup; Andy (MW0MWZ) is testing for Pi-Star version 4.3.x

The 'NEW' Editor files (Editor 0.58 and up) has 'NE' in the filename. Al my new Editor screens are build and tested with v1.60 Editor.

Basic screens has 'T' in the screen-model number; Enhanced has 'K' in the screen-model number; SMPLX is for simplex-, DPLX for duplex hotspots.

Examples:

N4024K032-NE_DPLX is a NEW Editor Enhanced screen, 3.2 inch for Duplex hotspot;

N4024T032-NE_SMPLX is a NEW Editor Basic screen, 3.2 inch for Simplex hotspot.

Have fun | PD0DIB / Rob van Rheenen
