#All files in this folder are for the LST Editor (aka 'OLD' Editor, v0.54 and down).

REMARK: once you only opened one of this files in the latest editor (v0.58 or up) the file can't be used with the LST editor; you have to download it again.
Ofcourse, you can use this files in the new editor, but you have to replace the fonts (ON7LDS-type font) into an accepted by the new editor font.

Have fun! | 73 de PD0DIB / Rob van Rheenen
