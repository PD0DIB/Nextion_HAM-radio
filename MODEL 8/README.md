#The Model 8 Dasboard files (screens) in this section has as a start-screen (MMDVM-page) where most system parameters showed
(temperature, CPU cyles, etc..); different from the "GLOBE" screens.

REMARK: I'm migrating the MODEL 8 line to Model 10 - The New Series. If you cann't find your screensize or -model
goto to the folder "Model 10 - The New Series"

Have fun! PD0DIB | Rob van Rheenen
