#The Model 8 Dasboard files (screens) in this section has as a start-screen (MMDVM-page) where most system parameters showed
(temperature, CPU cyles, etc..); different from the "GLOBE" screens.

However, converting these files are not my highest prio; GLOBE screens are....

So you don't find all screen-sizes in this folder (yet).

Have fun! PD0DIB | Rob van Rheenen
