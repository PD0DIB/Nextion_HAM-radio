In this Repository you find my latest Nextion screens for HAM Radio.
Please read this instructions:

  (1) ALL ScreenLayouts are for Basic & Enhanced screen models:
   * If you got an error that the files isn't matching your model, Check if you downloaded a version for your screen size
   * If you have the correct screen size downloaded, open that file with the Nextion Editor and select your model (Basic or Enhanced) in Device Menu, than save that file and upload via USBtoTTL adapter or compile and transfer via SDCard to your screen.
     
  (2) Set the Port the way you have connected your screen:
