In this folder, my 'experimental' screens for the Nextion Intelligent series.

They are operational, but still work in progress.

#REMARK: Screens, designed specific for the Nextion Intelligent, are not 'downgrade' compatible with Basic or Enhanced type of Nextion screens. 
Since the Intelligent has some special attributes I'm using, they are not usable for other types of screens.

Have fun! PD0DIB | Rob van Rheenen
