# Model 10 for SIMPLEX hotspots

This folder contains the Model 10 (.hmi) files for Simplex hotspots.

==> REMARK:

All my Model 10 (Duplex and Simplex) needs the ON7LDS NextionDriver to display full info;

Instructions and install-script for ON7LDS NextionDriver:

https://github.com/on7lds/NextionDriverInstaller

it will work without the NextionDriver, but only basic info will be displayed.

Have fun
