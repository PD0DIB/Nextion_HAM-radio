Model 10 - The new series

The Model 10 is based on Model 8, but evolved with new possibilities en features Not all Screentypes and -sizes are migrated to Model 10 yet, it is work-in-process

#REMARK: Screens, designed specific for the Nextion Intelligent, cann't be 'downgraded' to Basic or Enhanced type of Nextion screens. Since the Intelligent has some special attributes I'm using, they are not usable for other types of screens.

Have fun! PD0DIB | Rob van Rheenen
