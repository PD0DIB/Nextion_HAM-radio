# Model 10 for DUPLEX hotspots
This folder contains the Model 10 (.hmi) files for Duplex hotspots.

==> REMARKS:

1)

All my Model 10 (Duplex and Simplex) needs the ON7LDS NextionDriver to display full info;

it will work without the NextionDriver, but only basic info will be displayed.

2)

3.2-inch Basic isn't in the repositary due of flash-memory errors/shortness; 

3.5 Basic is there, but not tested with a Basic screen (all works fine with an Enhanced), could give memory issues too.

Have fun
