The files (screens) in this section are made with the LST editor ( version <0.54) and can not be used or with
the latest version (v 0.56 or up).

You can download the LST Editor at: www.nextion.tech site. Pick the ZIP version, which has an .exec file in it. That one doesn't need to be installed and can be used together with the new editor.

However, you can modify the files by changing / substitute the fonts into an accepted font-type for the new Ediotor
and recompile this file.
