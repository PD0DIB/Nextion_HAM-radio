The How-To tutorial in this section is written using the LST ('Old") editor. The new editor (v. 0.56 and up) has more powerfull features which are not used by this tutorial.

However, it still is an excelent document to start with, learning the basics 'How to use and build/modify" your own screens.

Have fun!
