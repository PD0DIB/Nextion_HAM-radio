The Nextion: How-To-Build tutorial in this section is written using the LST ('Old") editor. 

The new editor (v. 0.56 and up) has more powerfull features which are not used by this tutorial.

However, it still is an excelent document to start with, learning the basics 'How to use and build/modify" your own screens.

The Basic fields document describes all variable fields, provisioned by your hotspot (MMDVM and ON7LDS NextionDriver).

Have fun! PD0DIB | Rob van Rheenen
