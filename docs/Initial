In the /docs map you will find tutorials, write-ups, etc.. which are highly recommended to read before asking questions already answered.
As an add-endum, in the Wiki part of this repository you found FAQ-sheets for specialized subjects like how0-to-connect, the NextionDriver, etc..
Please check this folder regulary for new documents which can help you to use Nextion screens successfully on your build.
